Dear whoever, do you remember?
It's me, old whats-her-name
Can't believe it, you ain't dreaming
I don't look quite the same

But history repeats itself
And now we're making a scene
I can't promise it now
But they call me a queen
Your moment has passed
Tell me how does it feel?

I'm looking down from the skyline
Dancing on the moonlight
Can you see my name in the stars?
Yeah, I bet you won't forget me now
My voice on the airwaves
It's echoing louder and louder
I bet you won't forget me now
Hey!

Hey whoever, it's been forever
I know you know my name
I heard you're still trying to steal my throne
I guess some things never change

I always knew I could make it out
I have a life you dream about
And now the world's in my hands
According to plan

I'm looking down from the skyline
Dancing on the moonlight
Can you see my name in the stars?
Yeah, I bet you won't forget me now
My voice on the airwaves
Echoing louder and louder
I bet you won't forget me now
Hey!

Said you were gonna run this town
Now you just get high and drive around
It didn't happen like you thought it would, yeah
Hit me up like "hope you're good"
And "can you put me on the list tonight? "
And "by the way I've got this clothing line"
Trying to talk like we're old friends
But you don't even know who I am

I'm looking down from the skyline
Dancing on the moonlight
Can you see my name in the stars?
Yeah, I bet you won't forget me now
My voice on the airwaves
Echoing louder and louder
I bet you won't forget me now
I bet you won't forget me now
I bet you won't
