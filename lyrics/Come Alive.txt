I've been floating on a dark wave
Don't want nobody to come rescue me
No direction in mind
I'm just killing time
I gave my body to the riptide
Maybe it will put me back to sleep
It was the last thing I had
Now I can't get it back

There's a war inside my mind
But I'm the only one who fights
And I get lost here every night
I'm just trying to survive

I want to come alive, come alive
Tell myself that it's alright
Come alive, come alive
Yeah, I'm tired but I gotta fight
I want to come alive, come alive
No more sleepwalking through life
Come alive, come alive
Yeah, I'm tired but I gotta fight

Still a slave to my emotions
Yeah, they always get the best of me
I'm tired of feeling like shit
But I'm too numb to quit it

There's a war inside my mind
But I'm the only one who fights
And I get lost here every night
I'm just trying to survive

I want to come alive, come alive
Tell myself that it's alright
Come alive, come alive
Yeah, I'm tired but I gotta fight
I want to come alive, come alive
No more sleepwalking through life
Come alive, come alive
Yeah, I'm tired but I gotta fight

(I'm just trying to survive)
I'm alright but that's a lie
I'm not alright, I'm not alright

I want to come alive, come alive
Tell myself that it's alright
Come alive, come alive
Yeah, I'm tired but I gotta fight
I want to come alive, come alive
No more sleepwalking through life
Come alive, come alive
Yeah, I'm tired but I gotta fight

(Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive)
Yeah I'm tired but I gotta fight
