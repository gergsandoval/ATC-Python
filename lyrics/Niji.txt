As I tie my laces up now I'm ready to go
Even the wind it seems to force me forward
Using the light that shines through these kinds of doubts
That chase all of those dreams that were long forgotten
I can feel my heart racing with the beat
Mixed with feelings of doubt and looking 'head
Is everything really gonna be okay?
So can we really make it out the other side?

It's alright, if you look up
It's alright, look, the bridge of seven colors
When you shed your last tears, there would be a bridge to cross
Hey, you can see it far away, right?
I am seeing what you are seeing too
The two skies are now as one
Finally, we're able to laugh under the same sky

We were born under two totally different skies
Each star holds different memories for us
You have many stories that of course are all your own
And shed some tears that I don't know about
On a day when I was smiling and was so carefree
You could have been hurt or crying
We might have felt the same types of joy
But the hard times are all on our own
And all the promises we make to shape our future
We decorate with words of hopes in our dreams
You always hope for a better tomorrow
And I know more than anything or anyone else

As one of the four seasons
It's okay to be sad when you are
You don't need to force yourself to be happy
It's alright, I'm here
It's alright, I'm not going anywhere
When you start running, I will run with you

If there was ever a world that had no tears
Would there even be a bridge to cross?
You tried everything you could to numb the pain
Afraid of getting wet from the rain
You tried to build a bridge by simply running away
From all the troubles that followed you
But now you throw away your umbrella and simply close your eyes

It's alright, if you look up
It's alright, look, the bridge of seven colors
The tears have finished shedding under your sky
Hey, you can see the vivid colors, right?
You are seeing what I am seeing too
The rainbow named "bonds" has been formed, hasn't it?
The two skies have finally become one 
We're going to run
