All along you were see-through
I was just closing my eyes
I didn't wanna see you
Fell for all my own lies
No, I can't escape the truth
I don't wanna rewind
I'd rather rip out all the tape from the shitty mistake
Yeah, I'll be fine

Your skin is made of glass
And I wanna throw stones
You don't care about the mess
That you leave when you go
You say I'm such a bitch
But what do you know?
I know we've said this all before
But I'm so tired of waging war

You won't see me shatter, shatter, ay
And no, I won't shatter, shatter, ay
Time always heals what we break
Eventually faces will fade
And I don't want to shatter, shatter, shatter, shatter, ay

And you always call me
But you never did before
I guess I had to leave you
For you to treat me like I'm yours
Now you wanna escape the truth
I don't wanna be blind
I gotta keep you out at arm's length
Just to keep my heart safe
Yeah, I'll be fine

You won't see me shatter, shatter, ay
And no, I won't shatter, shatter, ay
Time always heals what we break
Eventually faces will fade
And I don't want to shatter, shatter, shatter, shatter, ay

Your skin is made of glass
And I wanna throw stones
You don't care about the mess
That you leave when you go
You say I'm such a bitch
But what do you know?
I know we've said this all before
But I'm so tired of waging war

You won't see me shatter, shatter, ay
And no, I won't shatter, shatter, ay
Time always heals what we break
Eventually faces will fade
And I don't want to shatter, shatter, shatter, shatter
You won't see me shatter, shatter, ay
And no, I won't shatter, shatter, ay
Time always heals what we break
Eventually faces will fade
I don't want to shatter, shatter, shatter, shatter, ay
