Why you so afraid to face it?
Why you so okay with wasting time?
Bitter happy and you're faking
Lost inside that black hole

So if you wanna run away
Tired of dreaming what it's all about
And every time you get close
You try to change but you choke
Don't be afraid to let it go

So just jump
What are you waiting...
What are you waiting for?
Don't be afraid of wanting something more
Jump
Into the deep end
To find your way back up
Don't be afraid of wanting more
Just jump

You only miss it when it's all gone
It's hard to see it 'cause you sunk so low
You keep on saying that the sun's gone
Lost inside that black hole

So if you wanna run away
Tired of dreaming what it's all about
And every time you get close
You try to change but you choke
Don't be afraid to let it go

So just jump
What are you waiting...
What are you waiting for?
Don't be afraid of wanting something more
Jump
Into the deep end
To find your way back up
Don't be afraid of wanting more
Just jump

What are you waiting...
What are you waiting for?
Just jump
What are you waiting...
What are you waiting for?

So just jump
What are you waiting...
What are you waiting for?
Don't be afraid of wanting something

Jump
What are you waiting...
What are you waiting for?
Don't be afraid of wanting something more
Jump
Into the deep end
To find your way back up
Don't be afraid of wanting more
Just jump
