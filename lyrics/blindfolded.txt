Diamonds dripping down my throat
Why's it gotta be so addictive
Now I'm Chasing after antidotes
For anything that tastes like a quick fix
Days like this no nothing feels right
Nothing sticks I can't get out my mind
Tell myself to let it go
I wish that I could let it go

It's hard to keep it down now
But I need to let the fever sweat out

Now I can't stand still should be running free
And all these nightmares used to be daydreams
I got my eyes wide open
Don't wanna care bout nothin'
Wish I could know less just go back to bed
Cause all my pink skies have been painted red
If this is real don't show it
I wanna run blindfolded

Reality's a bitter taste
But fantasy can be so deceiving
All my good intentions gone to waste
I'll do anything to shut out this feeling
I can't go back, no I've gone too far
I miss the way, that my eyes filled with stars
Tell myself to let it go but I don't
I wish that I could let it go

Now I can't stand still should be running free
And all these nightmares used to be daydreams
I got my eyes wide open
Don't wanna care bout nothin'
Wish I could know less just go back to bed
Cause all my pink skies have been painted red
If this is real don't show it
I wanna run blindfolded
(Run blindfolded)

Take a sip have it anyway you want it
Drink it in let us finish what ya started
Throw a fit yeah I guess I should called it
Now it's stolen
I'm blindfolded

Stand still should be running free
And all these nightmares used to be daydreams
I got my eyes wide open
Don't wanna care bout nothin'
Wish I could know less just go back to bed
Cause all my pink skies have been painted red
If this is real don't show it
I wanna run blindfolded
