Do you remember, feeling invincible?
When there was trouble
It was us against the world
We kept running, running through the night
Chasing the sun till anything felt right

Can you save me now?
I get lost up in the clouds
Can you save me now?
You were my gravity
Can you save me now?
When the ground drops out
I get lost in the clouds
Save me now
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering

You were my gravity
You were my gravity

You left me out there
With no one but myself
In an open field
For lightning to strike me down
I was the moon you were the sun
I can't seem to shine now that you're gone
Now I'm out of orbit cause you left with no word
Are you somewhere better now?

Can you save me now?
I get lost up in the clouds
Can you save me now?
You were my gravity
Can you save me now?
When the ground drops out
I get lost in the clouds
Save me now?
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering

You were my gravity
You were my gravity

When you went away thought I'd never be the same
When would the nightmare ever end
If I could do it again I wouldn't change
A thing cause it's made me who I am

Now I'm shattering

Can you save me now?
When the ground drops out
I get lost in the clouds
Save me now?
You were my gravity
Can you save me now?
When the ground drops out
I get lost in the clouds
Save me now?
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering

Now my world is shattering

You were my gravity
