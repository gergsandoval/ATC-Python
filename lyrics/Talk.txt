You say you adore me
But your eyes tell a story I've heard before
And damn boy you must think I'm dumb
As if I didn't know about the things you've done

Got a girl in every city
But somehow you're still lonely
I'm not the one to sit around waiting by my phone
While you're wasted telling other girls they're beautiful

So why don't we just call it what it is?
We both know we're getting what we give

You say you really wanna change
But all you do is talk, talk, talk then walk the same way
I say what you don't wanna say
I think we better stop, stop, stop before it's too late

Don't say you wanna stay forever
We both know that I know you better
You say you really wanna change
But all you do is talk, talk, talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk!

I say I don't want this
But I know that I miss you when you're gone
And being tangled up in those sheets
But I know that you're not what's good for me

So why don't we just call it what it is?
'Cause everybody knows you're full of shit

You say you really wanna change
But all you do is talk, talk, talk then walk the same way
I say what you don't wanna say
I think we better stop, stop, stop before it's too late

Don't say you wanna stay forever
We both know that I know you better
You say you really wanna change
But all you do is talk, talk, talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk!

Baby you know all you do
Is keep talking me back to you
Your words don't mean a thing
'Cause I'm done listening

All you do is talk
All you do is talk
All you ever do is talk, talk, talk, talk

You say you really wanna change
But all you do is talk, talk, talk then walk the same way
I say what you don't wanna say
I think we better stop, stop, stop before it's too late

Don't say you wanna stay forever
We both know that I know you better
You say you really wanna change
But all you do is talk, talk, talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk!

Talk, talk, talk, yeah
