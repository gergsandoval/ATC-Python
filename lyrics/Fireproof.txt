I was better off the night before I met you
But I was mesmerized and high on every word you spoke
You were born to run
But your poison tongue won't save you
Cause when you play with fire it all dissolves to smoke
I hope your hands burn, when you touch her
I won't be the cure for the scars you've earned
You lit the fuse, thought I'd burn too
But you're playing with a heart that's fireproof

Turn the whites behind those eyes
But I can feel it (I can feel it, I can feel it)
The kind of danger in the darkness written on your soul
If the brightest star can light the skies forever (forever)
How could you ever think you were invincible?

I hope your hands burn, when you touch her
I won't be the cure for the scars you've earned
You lit the fuse, thought I'd burn too
But you're playing with a heart that's fireproof
I watch your flames rise, destroy your alibis
I should have warned you
You're playing with a heart that's fireproof
No more games, can't escape
You will always be my worst mistake
Gasoline, on your grave
Goin' down in flames, goin' down in flames
Goin' down in flames

No more games, can't escape
You will always be my worst mistake
Gasoline, on your grave
Goin' down, in, flames
I hope your hands burn, when you touch her
I won't be the cure for the scars you've earned
You lit the fuse, thought I'd burn too

But you're playing with a heart that's fireproof
I watch your flames rise, destroy your alibis
I should have warned you
You're playing with a heart that's fireproof
You're playing with a heart that's fireproof
