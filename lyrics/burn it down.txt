Would you rather fight
Or curl up in the pain
It's a cynics life if you fantasize
And change nothing at all
You could vilify
The ones who walked away
But you're paralyzed, you don't even try
To change nothing at all

Some say they won't follow if you go
(Don't let 'em stop you, don't need 'em)
But every revolution starts alone

Burn it down 'cause we outgrew this house
Unafraid but we lost our way
Burn it down, don't fear the fallout
What does it take just to break away?
If you want you can find a way out
Don't gotta die in the bed you made
Burn it down, right here, right now
What does it take just to break away?

Deep end, feel it creeping in
But you can't swim, let the water in your lungs
All in, you cross your fingers
But you're losing every time

Some say they won't follow if you go
(Don't let 'em stop you, don't need 'em)
But every revolution starts alone

Burn it down 'cause we outgrew this house
Unafraid but we lost our way
Burn it down, don't fear the fallout
What does it take just to break away?
If you want you can find a way out
Don't gotta die in the bed you made
Burn it down, right here, right now
What does it take just to break away?
(What does it take just to break away?)

Fight back, might not end defeated
Don't crash, you've been at it too long
Too bad, your body's brave enough to
Lose at and let it die, fight back
You might not end defeated, don't crash
You've been at it too long, too bad
Your body's brave enough to, lose and let it die

Burn it down 'cause we outgrew this house
Unafraid but we lost our way
Burn it down, don't fear the fallout
What does it take just to break away?
If you want you can find a way out
Don't gotta die in the bed you made
Burn it down, right here, right now
What does it take just to break away?

Fight back, you might not end defeated
Don't crash, you've been at it too long
Too bad nobody's brave enough to
Lose and let it die
