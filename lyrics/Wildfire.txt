They say it started like a wildfire
It's kind of funny that you had me written off dead
Now we're coming for the empire
So now you love me, but you ain't seen nothing yet

Go tell 'em watch me, keep your eyes on me
I caught you sleeping before, now I'm in your head
You can't close it, the doors are open
Nah, you ain't seen nothing yet

They say it started like a wildfire
I feel it spreading in a new way 'bout right now
Change the game, build an empire
If you're ready we can spark it up, we can spark this all right now

I've been dreaming of a wildfire
I keep feeling the flames 'bout to boil my blood
Oh, kingdom getting so tired
It's a damn good day to go and change this up

Just tell 'em watch us, keep your eyes on us
Now we're running away, I'm living in your head
Can't contain us, there's no escaping
Nah, you ain't seen nothing yet

They say it started like a wildfire
I feel it spreading in a new way 'bout right now
Change the game, build an empire
If you're ready we can spark it up, we can spark this all right now

They say it started like a wildfire
I feel it spreading in a new way 'bout right now
Change the game, build an empire
If you're ready we can spark it up, we can spark this all right now

They say it started like a wildfire
New way 'bout right now
You ain't seen nothing
You ain't seen nothing yet
