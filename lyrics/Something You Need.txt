That night I still remember
It was warm in the middle of the summer
You voice like a lullaby, so low so sweet

Tought you had me but I never been so free
Now you're scared but you don't know why
You keep running but there is no where to hide

You never tought I ever be
Something you want, something you need
Oh, oh we got lost in the summer heat

Now you just can't get over me
We spend the night watching movies in the dark
You're playing bands I've never heard of

And I know you tend to always overthink
But tonight is as simple as just kissing me
Now you're scared but you don't know why

You keep running but there is no where to hide
Scared to care because then you lose
Trying to hide how you feel but I feel it too

You never tought I ever be
Something you want, something you need
Oh, oh we got lost in the summer heat

Now you just can't get over me
Take all of your doubts and throw them away
We're falling tonight tell me that you'll stay

You'll stay
You never tought I ever be
Something you want, something you need

Oh, oh we got lost in the summer heat
Now you just can't get over me
You never tought I ever be

Something you want, something you need
Oh, oh we got lost in the summer heat
Now you just can't get over me
