Rooftop tonight
We are the skyline
Collecting shooting stars
Wishes in a jar
All the hearts wide awake and lonely
Dream of where we are

Run so fast
The wind can't catch us
It's at our backs
The sun is falling
Things don't last
When your young cause
All you got is just one chance to

Break away to beat the odds
All along it's been a race against the clock
Time won't wait
We're gonna leave
Somewhere we'll find infinity

Find infinity

Breaking hearts just for the hell of it
Anything so we can feel dangerous
Everywhere we go we leave shadows from the past
We won't die young but we'll live fast

Run so fast, the wind can't catch us
It's at our backs
The sun is falling
Things don't last when you're young cause
All you get is just one change to break away
To beat the odds
All along it's been a race against the clock time
Won't wait we're gonna leave
Somewhere we'll find infinity

Find infinity
Infinity

Break away to beat the odds
All along it's been a race against the clock time
Won't wait we're gonna leave
Somewhere we'll find infinity

Break away to beat the odds
All along it's been a race against the clock time
Won't wait we're gonna leave
Somewhere we'll find infinity
Somewhere we'll find infinity
We'll find infinity
