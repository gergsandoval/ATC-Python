Just another lullaby

Swept by their undertow
Moved quick to drown me slow
Welcome to hell, is this it?
But still I surface in morning light
Strap up for another fight
Lick the blood off of my fist

And the gods keep saying
"You've been warned
They'll leave you stranded in their storms"
And now the rain just smells like war
Are monsters made or are they born?
And I've been here before

Tell me how you sleep at night, it doesn't seem fair
How the hell you dreaming when the world's a nightmare?
Did you hear a single word we said? 'Cause we're
Screaming out loud, but it seems our cries
Are just another lullaby

Come when the line is the drawn
Be careful what side you're on
Come through and twist up your wits
But still, I surface in morning light
Strap up for another fight
Then I feel so over this

And the gods keep saying
"You've been warned
They'll leave you stranded in their storms"
And I've been here before

Tell me how you sleep at night, it doesn't seem fair
How the hell you dreaming when the world's a nightmare?
Did you hear a single word we said? 'Cause we're
Screaming out loud, but nothing's coming out
Take your pretty smile, tell them everything's fine
Breaking all my bones to sharpen your knife
Did you hear a single word we said? 'Cause we're
Screaming out loud, but it seems our cries
Are just another lullaby

Tell me a lie
So I can sleep fine
Just another, just another lullaby
Just another lullaby

So tell me how you sleep at night, it doesn't seem fair
How the hell you dreaming when the world's a nightmare?
Did you hear a single word we said? 'Cause we're
Screaming out loud, but nothing's coming out
Take your pretty smile, tell them everything's fine
Breaking all my bones to sharpen your knife
Did you hear a single word we said? 'Cause we're
Screaming out loud, but it seems our cries
Are just another lullaby
