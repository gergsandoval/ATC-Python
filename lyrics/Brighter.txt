It's a brand new day
it's never too late to start
Can't live this life 
with an empty heart

Every single time that we lay it on the line
Its a roller coaster ride for one
When we know its do or die 
and were running out of time
We've gotta give it all we got
All we've got!

I want something more
a life worth fighting for
I don't need a reason
to set the world on fire
And burn a little bit brighter now
There's something beautiful
hiding in the shadows
So set the world on fire
Let's burn a little bit brighter now

Sometimes we gotta risk it all 
to chase a dream
If we dive in headfirst
all or nothing kind of thing

Every single time that we lay it on the line
Its a roller coaster ride for one
When we know its do or die 
and were running out of time
We've gotta give it all we got
All we've got!

I want something more
a life worth fighting for
I don't need a reason
to set the world on fire
And burn a little bit brighter now
There's something beautiful
hiding in the shadows
So set the world on fire
Let's burn a little bit brighter now

Can't stand by and wait like the others
I'm front line and won't run for cover
Head held high cause I'm burning brighter
Yeah I'm burning brighter!
Can't stand by and wait like the others
I'm front line and won't run for cover
Head held high cause I'm burning brighter
Yeah I'm burning brighter!

I want something more
a life worth fighting for
I don't need a reason
to set the world on fire
And burn a little bit brighter now
There's something beautiful
hiding in the shadows
So set the world on fire
Let's burn a little bit brighter now

It's a brand new day
it's never too late to start
