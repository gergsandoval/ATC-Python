Here come the pink skies
You know the night lies
It tears our walls down
And now we're waking up
Sober from the sun
I got you figured out

Lips on my forehead
I, drank every word you said
(Oo-ah)
I am through your kiss
I, I know what this is

Eyes like guns
Bullets on your tongue
Let 'em close up shop
I'm not too young to run
Hesitate, too late, you had a shot
Did you really think you could go breaking my heart?
Let 'em close up shop
I'm not too young to run

I wear it on my sleeve
While you're armed to the teeth
What are you scared of?
You used to hear me out
But I just turn you down
Before you start me up

Lips on my forehead
I drank every word you said
(Oo-ah)
I am through your kiss
I, I know what this is

Eyes like guns
Bullets on your tongue
Let 'em close up shop
I'm not too young to run
Hesitate, too late, you had a shot
Did you really think you could go breaking my heart?
Let 'em close up shop
I'm not too young to run
Ooh, I'm not too young to run

Eyes on me
I see them in the rearview
And hindsight knows we've got no future here, no
We've got no future here, no

Eyes like guns
Bullets on your tongue
Let 'em close up shop
I'm not too young to run
Hesitate, too late, you had a shot
Did you really think you could go breaking my heart?
Let 'em close up shop
I'm not too young to run

We've got no future here, no
