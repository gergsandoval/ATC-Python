We used to have a light
Now it's too dark to shine
Now we're just passing by
Two shipwrecks in the night

Remember when we met, yeah, I know I was mean
Stones shirt, black boots and black jeans
And you were such a mess
I thought it was sweet
But that night still haunts my dreams

I won't keep chasing ghosts
I need somebody I can hold
Gave you my heart and soul
Thought I was chasing love
I was only chasing a ghost

Blue from the TV light,
Two bodies intertwined
I guess we tempted fate
Always so far away

Remember when we met, yeah, I know I was mean
Stones shirt, black boots and black jeans
And you were such a mess
I thought it was sweet
But that night still haunts my dreams

I won't keep chasing ghosts
I need somebody I can hold
Gave you my heart and soul
Thought I was chasing love
I was only chasing a ghost

Remember when you left, yeah, I thought I was mean
Stones shirt, black boots and everything
I let you fool me twice, shame on me
But that night still haunts my dreams

I won't keep chasing ghosts
I need somebody I can hold
Gave you my heart and soul
Thought I was chasing love
I was only chasing a ghost
