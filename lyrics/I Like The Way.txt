I like the way that you look in my headlights
Climbing off your balcony
We drive away, luckier than that Lucky Strike
Hanging in-between your teeth

It's not a lot but it's sweet when it's simple
Don't overthink it, just dive in and let go
Don't complicate, I like you babe

I like the way my car smells with your cigarettes in my ashtray
I like the way that sun felt when it rose over the freeway
So I turn to you and say "Can you promise me now
That we're never gonna settle for settling down?"
I don't wanna think about the rest of my life
I just want the things I like

I found a burnt CD-R in your visor
From back when you were in a band
You laughed so hard it hurt
But I like how that guitar looked when it was in your hands

It's kinda sweet how you ramble when you're drinking
So stay with me, I'm addicted to this feeling
Don't complicate, I like you babe

I like the way my car smells with your cigarettes in my ashtray
I like the way that sun felt when it rose over the freeway
So I turn to you and say "Can you promise me now
That we're never gonna settle for settling down?"
I don't wanna think about the rest of my life
I just want the things I like

I like the way (I like the way)
I like you babe (I like the way)

I like the way my car smells with your cigarettes in my ashtray
I like the way that sun felt when it rose over the freeway
So I turn to you and say "Can you promise me now
That we're never gonna settle for settling down?"
I don't wanna think about the rest of my life
I just want the things I like

I like the way (I like the way)
I like the way (I like the way)
I just want the things I like
